# Docx to html converter

This tool was created to quickly convert Docx files to .html. I made this tool because I couldn't find any other tools that were able to do what I wanted 100%. [Batch DOC TO HTM Converter](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Office-tools/Other-Office-Tools/Batch-DOC-TO-HTM-Converter.shtml) was pretty good but it's partially paid. I also found [docx2html](https://www.npmjs.com/package/docx2html) which seems to do more or less the same but I haven't tried it besides the demo. 

Simpely drag the files into the box and press download. This tool is made to be easily accessible and expandable. If you have any questions, bugs or problems feel free to open an issue.
