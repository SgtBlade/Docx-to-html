# Docx to html converter

This tool was created to quickly convert Docx files to .html. I made this tool because I couldn't find any other tools that were able to do what I wanted 100%. [Batch DOC TO HTM Converter](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Office-tools/Other-Office-Tools/Batch-DOC-TO-HTM-Converter.shtml) was pretty good but it's partially paid. I also found [docx2html](https://www.npmjs.com/package/docx2html) which seems to do more or less the same but I haven't tried it besides the demo. 

## How to use:

#### 1. drag the files into the box and press download. 
#### 2. Press one of the download buttons.


This tool is made to be easily accessible and expandable. If you have any questions, bugs or problems feel free to open an issue.
